## Intro 
- The above analysis is part of the 2020 Big Contest Innovation Idea section, which is a project to present service ideas and to present proof of concept (POC) through new data analysis and modeling following the Corona virus.

- After the Corona virus, the focus was on the value of "unmannedness" according to the identification of consumer needs of untact and non-face-to-face values.

- Existing unmanned convenience stores were close to special convenience stores located in special commercial districts, but as the post-corona era began, they proposed an optimal transition location model aimed at unmanned general convenience stores.

## Data Analysis Flow & Strategy

- Unmanned convenience store characteristics make it difficult to select the correct data

- We also want to consider partial unmanned operation that reflects the characteristics of the floating population.

- Through clustering analysis, geographical characteristics are reflected and individual convenience store unit characteristics are scored

#

## Data 
- Contest-side data cannot be disclosed for security reasons 
- Contest-side data is used for Clustering analysis 

- Unmanned Convenience Store Unit Analysis Based on Kakao Developer and Public Data


#
#
## Analysis Flow 
We tried to analysis data for 2 perspectives  

first, Clustering  

Reason for Clsustering analysis is that We wanted to konw time or days When we utilize the Unmanned functions.  

 so that We can recommend what time is the best to change the Unmanned Convenience Store 
# 
 - Regional Analysis with Clustering 
  > Technique : DBSAN & t-SNE Dimenion Reduction

 Second, Scoring for Unit.  
 
 By scoring Convenience store, We could apprehend the list of Convenience Store tha is the best to change Unmanned.  
 
 #
 - Unit by Convenience Store Scoring 
  > Technique : equivalent weighting method
