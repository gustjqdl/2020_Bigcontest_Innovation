# Location-Selection-Analysis

### *Updating ....

## Intro 
- The above analysis is part of the 2020 Big Contest Innovation Idea section, which is a project to present service ideas and to present proof of concept (POC) through new data analysis and modeling following the Corona virus.

- After the Corona virus, the focus was on the value of "unmannedness" according to the identification of consumer needs of untact and non-face-to-face values.

- Existing unmanned convenience stores were close to special convenience stores located in special commercial districts, but as the post-corona era began, they proposed an optimal transition location model aimed at unmanned general convenience stores.



## Data Analysis Flow & Strategy
- Unmanned convenience store characteristics make it difficult to select the correct data

- We also want to consider partial unmanned operation that reflects the characteristics of the floating population.

- Through clustering analysis, geographical characteristics are reflected and individual convenience store unit characteristics are scored


## Data 
- Contest-side data cannot be disclosed for security reasons 
- Contest-side data is used for Clustering analysis 

- Unmanned Convenience Store Unit Analysis Based on Kakao Developer and Public Data




## Analysis Flow 
 - Regional Analysis with Clustering 
  > Technique : DBSAN & t-SNE Dimenion Reduction
 
 - Unit by Convenience Store Scoring 
  > Technique : equivalent weighting method
